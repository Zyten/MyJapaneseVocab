# MyJapaneseVocab

## Intro

I am taking a Japanese class weekly and intend to document my progress through this repository to serve as a source of reference as well as motivation.
This will be a long-term project.

## Immediate Goals

* Track vocabs. I hope to record all the vocabs I learn in class as I learn them.
* Equip vocab with sample sentences/phrases where possible.

## Long-term Goals

* Sort vocabs according to categories.
* Add hiragana alongside the words in roman

## How to contribute
*coming soon*
