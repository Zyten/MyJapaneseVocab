title: Daily Update Is Not Real

I've been slightly busy these few days and thus was not able to update the log. Nonetheless, I did spent time for 
Japanese. I have went through the entire katakana series on Memrise and attempted to commit them to memory based on
tofugu's mnemonics. I can map the kana and sound easily when there are options but find it difficult to instantly
recall the sound, yet. But it's still progress!

Other than that, I also went through Human Japanese up to Chapter 7. There were quite a few vocabs here but I've decided
to finish up Chapter 7 today and start another post for it tomorrow.
