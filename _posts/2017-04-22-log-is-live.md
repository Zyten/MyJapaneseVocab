title: Learning Log is Live!

So, I finally got the learning log up and running! It's built using a Jekyll-based theme and
hosted on Github Pages. I already had my domain redirecting to my Github Pages, therefore I
simply had to append this project's baseurl to all my static links here to get things working.

I did hit some snag with the theme I found though, delaying me considerably. The theme seem to be quite old 
and one of the dependencies was having issues on Windows. I spent a lot of time uninstalling and reinstalling 
the dependency but I was not familiar with Ruby and most of the solutions provided were for linux.

Finally, I ended up booting into my Elementary (thank God for dual boot XD) and installed the theme there before 
migrating to Windows. The downside is that I couldn't test it locally whilst modifying the template and had to push 
to Github and test it live. Now, I'm seriously thinking if I should somehow decouple all my source codes to make
it easy to switch workspaces. And eventually phase out my development to the linux box...

Nonetheless, the site is up and I should start posting my logs from tomorrow.  
Ganbatte ore!!
